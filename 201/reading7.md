# Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Reading

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
    - Domain modeling makes sure that we thoroughly understand a problem before we tackle it.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    - Issues with accessibility, "tag-soup" (unreadable HTML) and the issue that HTML tables are NOT responsive.
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
    - th, table head. tr, table row. td, table data.

## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    - A constructor is a way to declare an object. It allows you to create objects with different types of proporties.
2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    - A constructor allows you to declare multiple objects, a literal is one object.


## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
    - Prototypes are like a recepie; inheritence is chosing flavoring and specific things for that recepie when you make it.
